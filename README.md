🌡️ Ambient Temp Tracker
Ambient Temp Tracker is an embedded temperature monitoring and control system based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. 
It continuously measures ambient temperature, displays real-time readings on a 1602 LCD, and automatically regulates the temperature by activating a cooling fan or a heating lamp to keep it within a desired range.

🔧 Features
Real-time temperature monitoring
Automatic temperature regulation (fan/heater control)
LCD1602 display interface
Threshold-based response system
Fully functional prototype with PCB designed in Altium
Firmware developed using Arduino IDE

📦 Project Highlights
Designed with cost and component constraints in mind.
Full system design from specifications,requirements to hardware implementation.
Ideal for learning about embedded systems, control logic, and environmental sensing.
