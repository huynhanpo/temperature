Ambient Temp Tracker is an embedded system project designed to monitor and regulate ambient temperature using the ATmega328P microcontroller. The system continuously measures temperature and displays real-time values on a 1602 LCD screen. When the temperature goes beyond a defined threshold, it automatically activates a cooling fan or a heating lamp to bring the environment back to the desired range. The project was developed through a complete engineering workflow, starting from defining system specifications and cost constraints, selecting appropriate components, to building a fully functional prototype. The firmware was written in Arduino IDE, and the printed circuit board (PCB) was designed using Altium. This project serves as a practical example of environmental monitoring, embedded system design, and temperature control in real-time applications.
